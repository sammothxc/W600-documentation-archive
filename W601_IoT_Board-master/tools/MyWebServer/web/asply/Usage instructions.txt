Updated on June 30, 2011: 1. A message
review switch has been added to the website settings. Webmasters can choose whether to enable or disable the message review function based on their specific needs. 2. A
batch review function has been added to the website management. 3. The

Updated on December 3, 2010: 1.
Added a new formatting rule for phone number input to avoid spam messages. 2. Added
a notification when messages are being submitted. The submit button is also hidden during the message submission process. This prevents the server from responding slowly, causing customers to not know
whether to submit their messages and submitting
them repeatedly. 3. Added an editor to the message and reply area to facilitate backend administrators in managing and editing messages.
